正文：
1. have sb.（宾语 ）/sth. do sth（宾语补足语）
意为：让某人做某事
        此结构中的 have 是使役动词，sb 作宾语，其后的 do the 是省去 to 的动词不定式作并与补足语。
        The boss often has them work for 14 hours a day.
        I’ll have someone repair the bike for you
2. have sb /sth（宾语） doing（现在分词/宾语补足语）
        意为：叫/让某一直做某事或让某种情况发生
        宾语 sb/sth 后面用现在分词做宾语补足语，表示宾语与现在分词表示的动作之间为主动关系，且动作正在进行。
        Don’t have the baby crying!
        Don’t have the dog barking much, Lilin.
3. have sth(宾语) done（过去分词/宾语补足语）.
        意为：让/叫/使/请别人做某事
        宾语 sth 后面用过去分词作宾语补足语，说明 sth 与过去分词表示的动作之间是被动关系。
        We had the machine mended just now.
        He has had his hair cut. (他[请人给他]理发了）
4. have sth. to do  &  have sth. to be done.
         have sth. to do这一结构中的 have 意为“有”，即“有某事要做”，这件事是由主语来做的
         I have my dinner to cook.
         而 have sth. to be done.是有事要做，这件事本质上不是由主语来做的。
         I have my hair to be cut.

拓展：
使役动词：英语中使役动词是表示使、令、让、帮、叫等意义的不完全及物动词,主要有leave（离开）.get（得到）.keep（保持）.make（使，令）,let（让）,help（帮助）,have（有；让；从事；允许；拿）等。
使役动词后接宾语,再接原形不定词作受词补语。
He makes me laugh。
I let him go
i helped him repair the car
please have him come here
使役动词还可以接过去分词作受词补语。
I have my hair cut every month
使役动词的被动语态的受词补语用不定词,不用原形不定词。
He made me laugh
I was made me to laugh by him
