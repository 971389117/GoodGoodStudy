Put away the heavy clothes
The suspect were put away
It's time to put away those foolish ideas
The cold-blooded man decided to put away Sam
She went a bit odd and had to be put away
Let's unpack and put away our things.
Put away your unhappiness.




把厚衣服收起来吧
这些嫌疑人被关进了监狱
是该放弃那些愚蠢的想法了
这个冷血的男人决定要杀死山姆
她有点不正常,只好送进了疯人院
咱们打开行李把东西放好吧
把不开心收起来.
